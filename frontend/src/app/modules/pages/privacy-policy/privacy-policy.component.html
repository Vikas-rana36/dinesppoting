        personal information in the content you post publicly. You can minimize
        the risk of being personally identified by using the Service

      purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law.
      For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or
      identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply
      with legal obligations. We may also maintain residual copies of your
      personal information in our backup systems. Please note that businesses

        steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.

        transmission method over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of
        electronic storage, is 100% safe. Therefore, while we strive to use
        commercially acceptable means to keep your personal information secure,

        Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ( <b> "CCPA"</b>),
        California residents have certain rights regarding Dinespotting collection,
        use, and sharing of their personal information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Dinespotting does not sell your personal information and will not do so in
          the future without any notice and an opportunity to opt-out of such
          sale as required by law. Similarly, we do not offer any financial
          incentives related to our listing, use, or disclosure of your personal
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dinespotting collects various categories of personal information when you
          use the Service, including identifiers, commercial information,
          internet or other electronic network or device activity information,
          geolocation data, and professional information. A more detailed
          description of the information Dinespotting collects and how we use it is
          provided above in Section 1 (Information We Collect and How We Use
          It). Section 3 (Third Parties) describes the categories of third
          parties with whom we share personal information and what information
          may be shared under different scenarios
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to
          know what personal information has been collected about you and to
          access that information. You also have the right to request deletion
          of your personal information, though exceptions under the CCPA may
          allow Dinespotting to retain and use certain personal information
          notwithstanding your deletion request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different from the CCPA, California's Shine the Light law provides
          California residents the right to ask companies what personal
          information they share with third parties for those third parties'
          direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal
          information to third parties to directly market their goods or
          services to you unless you request such disclosure. If you have any
          questions regarding this policy or want to change your preferences,
          contact us.

    <h3>NEVADA RESIDENTS: YOUR NEVADA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Nevada law (SB 220) requires website operators to provide a way for
        Nevada consumers to opt-out of the sale of some specific information
        that the website operator may collect about them. Dinespotting does not sell
        your personal information to third parties as defined in Nevada law and
        will not do so in the future without providing you with notice and an
        opportunity to opt-out of the such sale as required by law. Please
        contact us through the Support Center if you have any questions
        regarding our data privacy practices or our compliance with Nevada data
        privacy law.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>UAE RESIDENTS: YOUR UAE PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
    <p>
      At the federal Level, Article 31 of the constitution of the UAE guarantees
      the right of all citizens and residents to a private life and imposes an
      obligation on organizations to keep all data and communication private and
      secure. Please contact us through the Support Center if you have any
      questions related to our data privacy practices or our compliance with UAE
      data privacy law.
